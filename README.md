# Workplace health assessments and short to long-term cardiovascular risk: A propensity score-matched emulated target trial in 2,091,421 Swedish workers

## Abstract

This study examines the association between Health Profile assessments and cardiovascular disease risk using an emulated target trial design with propensity score matching in a large Swedish worker population. We analyzed data from 2,091,421 workers to assess both instantaneous and time-varying effects of health assessments on cardiovascular outcomes.

## Study design

- **Design**: Emulated target trial with propensity score matching
- **Population**: 2,091,421 Swedish workers
- **Exposure**: Health Profile assessments (HPA)
- **Outcome**: Cardiovascular disease events
- **Analysis**: Cox proportional hazards models, and flexible parametric models for timevarying hazard ratios andrestricted mean survival time differences
